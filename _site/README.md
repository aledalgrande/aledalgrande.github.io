I create things.<br>Lots of things, challenging things.<br>Some in the Web, some not.

##### I contributed to Linux Debian AMD64

<div class="double">
  <p>
    In 2004-2005 I helped make Skype work on the first 64bit Linux distro.<br>What a hack!
  </p>

##### I helped a ton of public projects

<div class="double">
  <img src="assets/images/projects.png">
  <p>
    I worked on docs, issues and code to help the community. Including Facebook's Buck
    and Google's <a href="http://ceres-solver.org/version_history.html#id5">Ceres Solver</a>,
    the library powering Google Street Map reconstruction.

##### I worked on scaling apps big

<div class="double">
  <p>
    Whether there was the need of coming up with a real-time implementation for trending
    news used by <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ban-jo/id417076117?mt=8">millions
    of users</a>, or speeding up page loading time, or even a test suite, I used
    code and allocations profiling and cyclomatic complexity analysis to achieve it.

##### I saved time for other developers

<div class="double">
  <img src="assets/images/neon.png">
  <p>
    From <a href="https://gist.github.com/aledalgrande/5c666f38a5ad7f77ac9dd873300c099a">tools setup</a> to <a href="https://github.com/thenifty/neon-guide">assembly coding</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/@aledalgrande/3-ways-to-make-your-web-pages-more-responsive-with-sidekiq-a3fcb1e9dcef">Web performance optimization</a>, I summarized scarce and important information into tutorials and guides that could be useful to others.

##### My side project is mobile computer vision

<div class="double">
  <p>
    I built an app that uses complex algorithms to reconstruct 3D shapes from a
    mobile phone camera, using compute kernels on the GPU.
  </p>

#### I've made lots of things.

<div class="single">
  <p>
    I've written and shipped apps for <strong>iOS</strong>,
    <strong>APIs</strong> and full <strong>Rails</strong> apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the last 13 years I've written<br>
    Web,<br>
    desktop,<br>
    terminal, and<br>
    client/server apps,<br>
    in C++, Java, PHP, Objective-C, and Ruby.<br>
    (And quite a few others.)
  </p>
  <p>
    I've experimented with grammars and parsers. I've written and played with raycasting and mesh generation. Document generators, graph databases, Web servers, native bots‚ÄîI've been up to my elbows in all of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every side project I've done was because I was curious about how something worked.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wanted to explore it.
  </p>
  <h3>
    I wanted to understand it.
  </h3>
</div>

<hr class="stronghr">

## So, I learn things.

<hr class="stronghr">

#### Quickly, and well.<br>I want to know _why_.<br>And then I adapt.

<div class="single">
  <p>
    I'm good at it.<br>
    Set me a task, point me at a challenge,<br>
    and I'll get to the bottom of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Out of sheer curiosity and a desire to explore,<br>
    I've taught myself<br>
    Spanish, Japanese,<br>
    how to cook Michelin star dishes,<br>
    long running techniques,<br>
    clothes design,<br>
    patternmaking,<br>
    surfing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then I applied what I learned,<br>
    but differently.

### Because I [learn to survive](http://videos.liftconference.com/video/1169372/jean-claude-biver-the).

    Need to find a solution to a problem?

    Maybe another curious brain is what separates you from the solution.
